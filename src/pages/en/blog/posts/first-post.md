# Getting Started with Web Development

Web development is an exciting field that combines creativity with technical skills. Whether you're looking to build a simple personal website or aiming to become a professional developer, learning the fundamentals is essential.

## The Basic Building Blocks

Every website consists of three core technologies:

1. **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** - The structure of web pages
2. **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** - The styling and layout
3. **JavaScript** - The interactive functionality

### HTML: The Foundation

HTML provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript. HTML is used to create the skeleton of your web page.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first web page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### CSS: Adding Style

CSS is used to control the visual presentation of your HTML elements. It allows you to add colors, change fonts, adjust spacing, and create layouts.

```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

h1 {
    color: #333;
}

p {
    line-height: 1.6;
}
```

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with HTML and CSS, you can move on to learning JavaScript, which will allow you to create interactive elements and dynamic content on your websites.
